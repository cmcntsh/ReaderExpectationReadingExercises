# Reader Expectation Approach to Writing - Introductory Readings and Exercises

I've created a short list of readings and quick exercises to help someone get more familiar with the basics. I've formatted these as weekly assignments as part of an MS in Nursing Informatics course. A YouTube playlist is available to help introduce the assignments and demonstrate how to create the analysis assignment template. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nDEDs-BgEQ&list=PLJ1Hw7KPHJnoY8KOWTMcLT4KcCjQmUtYB

## Week 1

* Read: #1 A New Approach to Legal Writing https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_1_introduction.pdf
* Read: #42 Ave atque Vale: Retrospective Thoughts as I Lay Down My Pen https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation-42-ave-atque-vale.pdf
* Assignment: Tell everyone about your prior experience with writing. Have you done a lot of writing? Do you like to write? Do you have any favorite methods for helping you write well? If so, what are they? What prior experiences have been most influential or impactful for you as a writer? Also, tell us which reading for this week you liked the best and why.

## Week 2

* Read: #2 The Importance of Stress: Indicating the Most Important Words in a Sentence https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_2_stress_position.pdf
  * Good writing depends less on word choice and more on word placement—specifically, that the most important information in a sentence should appear in a “stress position” (just before a period, colon, or semicolon) so readers naturally give it emphasis and interpret the writer’s meaning correctly.
* Assignment: Select a paragraph from any of the readings this week with at least five sentences (or two paragraphs that total at least five sentences), and highlight what you think is the most important part of each sentence. (Preferably select a paragraph that makes a point or mentions something you think is important.) Where is the paragraph located in the document? (beginning, middle, end, or name of specific section) How many sentences are in the paragraph? How many of the important parts you highlighted are in a stress position as defined by George Gopen? (Stress positions are episodes of full syntactic closure next to a period, a semicolon, or a colon.) Suggest a way to change the paragraph or sentence to align with the goal described in the writing article. (If all the parts of the paragraph already meet the goal, then state that.) Share your analysis paper in the discussion.
* See Assignment Formatting section at the bottom.

## Week 3

* Read: #3 Ensuring readers Know What Actions Are Happening in Any Sentence https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_3_actions_and_verbs.pdf
  * Writers should place the true actions of a sentence in its verbs, not in nouns (nominalizations) or other parts of speech, because readers naturally look to verbs to understand what is happening—doing so makes writing clearer, stronger, and easier to comprehend.
* Assignment: Select a paragraph from any of the readings this week with at least five sentences (or two paragraphs that total at least five sentences), and highlight what you think is the main action the author is trying to convey in each sentence. (Preferably select a paragraph that makes a point or mentions something you think is important.) Where is the paragraph located in the document? (beginning, middle, end, or name of specific section) How many sentences are in the paragraph? How many of the main actions you highlighted are conveyed by a strong verb as described by George Gopen? (George Gopen defines a strong verb as a verb that conveys the main action of the sentence intended by the author.) Suggest a way to change the paragraph or sentence to align with the goal described in the writing article. (If all the parts of the paragraph already meet the goal, then state that.) Share your analysis paper in the discussion.

## Week 4

* Read: #4 Whose Story Is This Sentence? Directing Readers' Perception of Narrative https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_4_whose_story.pdf
  * Readers naturally understand a sentence as being the story of its grammatical subject, so writers should deliberately choose the subject of each main clause to control whose perspective or story the reader perceives—because clarity depends more on sentence structure and word order than on length.
* Assignment: Select a paragraph from any of the readings this week with at least five sentences (or two paragraphs that total at least five sentences), and highlight who/what you think the story is about in each sentence. (Preferably select a paragraph that makes a point or mentions something you think is important.) Where is the paragraph located in the document? (beginning, middle, end, or name of specific section) How many sentences are in the paragraph? How many of the main characters of the story you highlighted are contained in the first main clause of the sentence as described by George Gopen? (George Gopen defines a main clause as having a subject and a verb and can stand alone as a sentence.) Suggest a way to change the paragraph or sentence to align with the goal described in the writing article. (If all the parts of the paragraph already meet the goal, then state that.) Share your analysis paper in the discussion.

## Week 5

* Read: #7 Who Done It? Controlling Agency in Legal Writing, Part II https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_7_controlling_agency_pt2.pdf
  * Writers must clearly express who is doing what by putting actions in verbs and agents in subjects, rather than hiding them in abstract nouns (nominalizations)—because doing so makes writing clearer.
* Assignment: Select a paragraph from any of the readings this week with at least five sentences (or two paragraphs that total at least five sentences), and highlight what you think are the main actions the author is trying to convey in each sentence. (Preferably select a paragraph that makes a point or mentions something you think is important.) Where is the paragraph located in the document? (beginning, middle, end, or name of specific section) How many sentences are in the paragraph? How many main actions are in the paragraph? How many of the main actions of the sentences you highlighted are by nominalizations as described by George Gopen? (George Gopen defines a nominalization as a verb turned into a noun.) Suggest a way to change the paragraph or sentence to align with the goal described in the writing article. (If all the parts of the paragraph already meet the goal, then state that.) Share your analysis paper in the discussion.
  
## Week 6

* Read: #8 How to Overburden Your Reader; Separate Your Subject from Your Verb https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_8_s_v_c_separation.pdf
  * Separating a grammatical subject from its verb with intervening material overburdens the reader because it interrupts the expectation that the subject will be followed almost immediately by its verb. He recommends having four words or fewer between the subject and the verb.
* Assignment: Select a paragraph from any of the readings this week with at least five sentences (or two paragraphs that total at least five sentences), highlight the words between the subject and the verb, and count the number of words between the subject and the verb in each sentence. (Preferably select a paragraph that makes a point or mentions something you think is important.) Where is the paragraph located in the document? (beginning, middle, end, or name of specific section) How many sentences are in the paragraph? How easy or hard to read is each sentence? How many words come between the subject and the verb in each sentence? Go ahead and build a small table to report this information. Use 3 columns: sentence #, difficulty, # words between subject and verb. Suggest a way to change the paragraph or sentence to align with the goal described in the writing article. (If all the parts of the paragraph already meet the goal, then state that.) Share your analysis paper in the discussion.

## Week 7

* Read: #10 Why the Passive Voice Should Be Used and Appreciated - Not Avoided https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_10_why_the_passive_should_be_used.pdf
  * The passive voice should not be avoided; rather, it is a crucial tool, especially for sophisticated legal prose, because it allows writers to strategically place information in structural locations (subject position for "whose story," and stress positions for emphasis) where readers expect to find it for clear interpretation.
* Assignment: Select a paragraph from any of the readings this week with at least five sentences (or two paragraphs that total at least five sentences), and highlight the verb in each sentence. (Preferably select a paragraph that makes a point or mentions something you think is important.) Where is the paragraph located in the document? (beginning, middle, end, or name of specific section) How many sentences are in the paragraph? Is each sentence active or passive? Suggest a way to change the paragraph or sentence to align with the goal described in the writing article. (If all the parts of the paragraph already meet the goal, then state that.) Share your analysis paper in the discussion.

## Week 8

* Read: #12 The #2 Problem in Legal Writing: Solved https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_12_the_2_problem_in_legal_writing_solved.pdf
  * The number one problem in writing is failure to place the most important information in the sentence's stress position (at points of syntactic closure marked by periods, colons, or semicolons). The number two problem, which is a subset of the first, is that writers typically structure sentences by starting with a main clause and ending with a weaker qualifying clause, which confuses readers about which information to emphasize most.
* Assignment: Select a paragraph from any of the readings this week with at least five sentences (or two paragraphs that total at least five sentences) and highlight the main clause in each sentence. (Preferably select a paragraph that makes a point or mentions something you think is important.) Where is the paragraph located in the document? (beginning, middle, end, or name of specific section) How many sentences are in the paragraph? How many main clauses, qualifying clauses, and phrases does each sentence have as defined by George Gopen? (Gopen defines a main clause as having a subject and a verb and can stand by itself as a sentence. He defines a qualifying clause as having a subject and a verb, but can not stand by itself as a sentence. He defines a phrase as an identifiable unit of text that lacks a subject or a verb.) Suggest a way to change the paragraph or sentence to align with the goal described in the writing article. (If all the parts of the paragraph already meet the goal, then state that.) Share your analysis paper in the discussion.

## Week 9

* Read: #18 The Progress of Thought: To Move Forward, Link Backward https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_18_the_progress_of_thought.pdf
  * Clear writing requires a new sentence to explicitly link backward to the preceding sentence as soon as possible, guiding the reader's thought process. This backward link should target either the grammatical subject (the "whose story" position) or the end of the previous sentence (the "stress position") to maintain the flow of thought and prevent misinterpretation.
* Assignment: Select a paragraph from any of the readings this week with at least five sentences (or two paragraphs that total at least five sentences) and highlight the part of the sentence that links back to the previous sentence. (Preferably select a paragraph that makes a point or mentions something you think is important.) Where is the paragraph located in the document? (beginning, middle, end, or name of specific section) How many sentences are in the paragraph? How many sentences have a link back to the previous sentence? How many sentences DO NOT link back to the previous sentence? Suggest a way to change the paragraph or sentence to align with the goal described in the writing article. (If all the parts of the paragraph already meet the goal, then state that.) Share your analysis paper in the discussion.

## Week 10

* Read: #19 What's at Issue? The Construction of the English Paragraph, Part I https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_19_construction-english-paragraph.pdf
  * The traditional five-sentence "topic sentence" paragraph model is inadequate for professional writing. Instead, a paragraph should begin with a clear statement of the issue (what the paragraph is about) and strategically place the point (why the paragraph was written) either immediately after the issue or at the end of the discussion, where readers expect to find it.
* Read: #20 What's at Issue? The Construction of the English Paragraph, Part II https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_20_whats_at_issue_part_2.pdf
  * The issue of a paragraph must be stated up front to guide the reader. In sophisticated professional writing, it often requires more than a single sentence to be adequately expressed, and readers will accept a well-constructed issue that spans one, two, or even three sentences. However, the issue should never spill over into a fourth sentence, as readers typically lose hope, and coherence is lost.
* Read: #21 Connectivity: The Construction of the English Paragraph, Part III https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_21_connectivity.pdf
  * Paragraph coherence is achieved by controlling the reader's interpretive journey by making sure each sentence connects smoothly to its neighbors. This control is accomplished by leveraging three crucial reader expectations: placing the "whose story" in the subject position, emphasizing the material in the stress position (at the end of a clause or sentence), and providing an explicit link backward to the preceding sentence as soon as possible.
* Assignment: Select a paragraph from any of the readings this week with at least five sentences (or two paragraphs that total at least five sentences) and highlight the issue of the paragraph. (Preferably select a paragraph that makes a point or mentions something you think is important.) Where is the paragraph located in the document? (beginning, middle, end, or name of specific section) How many sentences were in the paragraph? How many sentences were part of the issue? Where were they located in the paragraph? Suggest a way to change the paragraph or sentence to align with the goal described in the writing article. (If all the parts of the paragraph already meet the goal, then state that.) Share your analysis paper in the discussion.

## Week 11

* Read: #22 The Point of a Paragraph and Where to Find It: The Construction of the English Paragraph, Part IV https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_22_point-of-paragraph.pdf
  * Readers expect to find a paragraph's point either at the end of the issue statement or at the end of the discussion section—essentially just before the discussion begins or just as it concludes. This challenges the traditional "topic sentence" approach by recognizing that sophisticated writing requires more flexible paragraph structures, in which the issue (what the paragraph concerns) and the point (why it was written) can be strategically placed in different locations depending on the complexity of the thought being developed.
* Read: #23 Five Varieties of Point Placement: The Construction of the English Paragraph, Part V https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_23_five-varieties-point-placement.pdf
  * Placement of a paragraph's explicit point is crucial and depends on its function, with readers having rigid expectations for five different paragraph types. For most medial paragraphs, the point is expected immediately after the issue to capture skimming readers, but for opening and final paragraphs, the point should be saved for the very last sentence to provide a sense of finality and fulfill the document's "contract".
* Assignment: Select a paragraph from any of the readings this week with at least five sentences (or two paragraphs that total at least five sentences) and highlight the point of the paragraph. (Preferably select a paragraph that makes a point or mentions something you think is important.) Where is the paragraph located in the document? (beginning, middle, end, or name of specific section) How many sentences were in the paragraph? Did the paragraph have a point? Where was it located in the paragraph? Suggest a way to change the paragraph or sentence to align with the goal described in the writing article. (If all the parts of the paragraph already meet the goal, then state that.) Share your analysis paper in the discussion.

## Week 12

* Read: #24 How Paragraphs Speak to Each Other https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_24_--_how_paragraphs_speak_to_each_other.pdf
  * For thought to flow clearly through a document, writers must control the connectivity between paragraphs by ensuring each new paragraph links backward to its predecessor. This backward link should be made as early as possible and target either the beginning (the issue) or the end (the stress position) of the previous paragraph, as these are the easiest points for the reader to recall.
* Assignment: Select two contiguous paragraphs in the same section from any of the readings this week with at least five sentences in at least one of them. Highlight the thing in the second paragraph that links it to the first paragraph. Also highlight the thing referred to in the first paragraph that was used as the backward link in the second paragraph. (Preferably select a paragraph that makes a point or mentions something you think is important.) Where is the paragraph located in the document? (beginning, middle, end, or name of specific section) How many sentences were in each paragraph? Did the second paragraph link back to the first? Where was the link back located in the second paragraph? Suggest a way to change the paragraph or sentence to align with the goal described in the writing article. (If all the parts of the paragraph already meet the goal, then state that.) Share your analysis paper in the discussion.

## Week 13

* Read: #25 A Quiver of Punctuation: How to Handle Two Clauses in One Sentence https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_25_punctuation_quiver___handling_2_clauses_in_1_sentence.pdf
  * The four major punctuation marks (period, colon, semi-colon, and comma) are essential tools for writers to explicitly control the reader's interpretation of multi-clause sentences. By using these marks, a writer can send clear reading instructions about two critical reader expectations: which clause is meant to be stressed and what the logical relationship is between the two clauses. The period, colon, and semi-colon indicate full syntactic closure and create stress positions in a sentence. The comma is an ambiguous punctuation mark because the reader must read further in the sentence to determine what role the comma plays in the sentence. (There are multiple grammar rules that govern the use of the comma.) As a result, commas don’t create stress positions in the sentence. On the contrary, most readers interpret information placed just before the comma as less important.
* Read: #29 A Once Rogue Punctuation Mark Gains Respectability: What You Can Now Accomplish with an M-Dash https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_29___a_once_rogue_punctuation_mark_gains_respectability.pdf
  * The M-dash has moved from a "rogue" mark to a respected punctuation tool that provides writers with three powerful new ways to explicitly control the reader's interpretation. It can be used to distinguish lightweight lists, to signal that an interruption is of greater importance (unlike parentheses), and to highlight that the material in the final stress position is the most important information in the sentence.
* (Optional) A summary of Gopen's review of the use of different punctuation marks he wrote in one of his books is available at https://github.com/cmcntsh/ReaderExpectationApproachWriting#use-of-punctuation
* Assignment: Select a paragraph from any of the readings this week with at least five sentences (or two paragraphs that total at least five sentences) and highlight all the periods, semicolons, and colons. (Preferably select a paragraph that makes a point or mentions something you think is important.) Where is the paragraph located in the document? (beginning, middle, end, or name of specific section) How many sentences were in the paragraph? How many times were each of those punctuation marks used? Where do you feel the writer used punctuation effectively or could have done a better job? Provide examples to justify your assessments. Suggest a way to change the paragraph or sentence to align with the goal described in the writing article. (If all the parts of the paragraph already meet the goal, then state that.) Share your analysis paper in the discussion.
