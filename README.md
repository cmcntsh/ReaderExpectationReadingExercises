# Reader Expectation Approach Readings and Exercises

I've created a short list of readings and quick exercises to help someone get more familiar with the basics. I've formatted these as weekly assignments as part of an MS in Nursing Informatics course.

## Week 1

* Read: #1 A New Approach to Legal Writing https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_1_introduction.pdf
* Read: #42 Ave atque Vale: Retrospective Thoughts as I Lay Down My Pen https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation-42-ave-atque-vale.pdf
* Assignment: Tell everyone about your prior experience with writing. Have you done a lot of writing? Do you like to write? Do you have any favorite methods for helping you write well? If so, what are they? What prior experiences have been most influential or impactful for you as a writer? Also, tell us which reading for this week you liked the best and why.

## Week 2

* Read: #2 The Importance of Stress: Indicating the Most Important Words in a Sentence https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_2_stress_position.pdf
* Assignment: Select a paragraph from any of the readings this week with at least five sentences (or two paragraphs that total at least five sentences), and highlight what you think is the most important part of each sentence. (Preferably select a paragraph that makes a point or mentions something you think is important.) Where is the paragraph located in the document? (beginning, middle, end, or name of specific section) How many sentences are in the paragraph? How many of the important parts you highlighted are in a stress position as defined by George Gopen? (Stress positions are episodes of full syntactic closure next to a period, a semicolon, or a colon.) Suggest a way to change the paragraph or sentence to align with the goal described in the writing article. (If all the parts of the paragraph already meet the goal, then state that.) Share your analysis paper in the discussion.

## Assignment Formatting

This assignment format is intended to be used for all of the assignments. An example assignment is posted in the repository.

* Put your assignment response in a Word document.
* Use APA level 1 headings for sections of the assignment. Use the following sections:
  * Title
  * Paragraph
  * Paragraph Attributes
  * Improvement Suggestion
  * References
* The content for each section should be as follows:
  * Title: Create a descriptive title for the assignment that includes what attribute of the writing was the focus of the analysis. Write a short sentence or two about what you liked about the article or the paragraph you selected to analyze. Cite the article with an APA citation. Write a short sentence or two describing what you analyzed about your paragraph. Use the proper APA citation format for the article that describes the analysis criteria and the paragraph source.
  * Paragraph: Put the text of your paragraph with the requested highlighting in this section.
  * Paragraph Attributes: Write a sentence directing the reader to see the paragraph attribute information in the APA table. Put a short APA table with the requested information in this section.
  * Improvement Suggestion: Put your revised sentence or paragraph in this section.
* References: Include the APA reference for the source article for the paragraph you analyzed and the writing article(s) that describes the analysis criteria.
