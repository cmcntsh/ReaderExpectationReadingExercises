# Reader Expectation Approach Readings and Exercises

I've created a short list of readings and quick exercises to help someone get more familiar with the basics. I've formatted these as weekly assignments as part of an MS in Nursing Informatics course.

## Week 1

* Read: #1 A New Approach to Legal Writing https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_1_introduction.pdf
* Read: #42 Ave atque Vale: Retrospective Thoughts as I Lay Down My Pen https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation-42-ave-atque-vale.pdf
* Assignment: Tell everyone about your prior experience with writing. Have you done a lot of writing? Do you like to write? Do you have any favorite methods for helping you write well? If so, what are they? What prior experiences have been most influential or impactful for you as a writer? Also, tell us which reading for this week you liked the best and why.
